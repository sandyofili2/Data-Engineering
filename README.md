# Data-Engineering

For every project listed only one programming langauge is used. I wanted to show my skills in each language by creating seperate projects with each language.In the last project I use multiple languages and dictionaries to create a seamless data pipeline.

#SQL_STORES# - In the SQL_STORES project I used the stores database that had customer, product, order etc information. 
The most important questions that I was looking to find answers to were: Top 5 biggest spenders, The top 5 leaset engaged customers, the average profit per customer which would then help us in determining how much to spend on advertising.
