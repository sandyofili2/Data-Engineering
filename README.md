# Data-Engineering

For every project listed only one programming langauge is used. I wanted to show my skills in each language by creating seperate projects with each language.In the last project I use multiple languages and dictionaries to create a seamless data pipeline.

**SQL_STORES** - In the SQL_STORES project I used the stores database that had customer, product, order etc information. 
The most important questions that I was looking to find answers to were: Top 5 biggest spenders, The top 5 leaset engaged customers, the average profit per customer which would then help us in determining how much to spend on advertising.

**Growth_of_Kpop** - In the Growth_of_Kpop Project I used pandas and numpy to do an analysis on top artists on the South Korean Melon Charts from 2010 to 2023. It consisted of analysing 66000 rows and 6 colums of data. I used Seaborn and Matplotlib for the visualization section of the project. I focused on answering questions to 5 questions:

1.Which artists had the most songs on the Melon 200 chart from 2010 till 2013?
2.Which artist has the most number 1 songs on Melon chart?
3.Which Korean song spent the longest time at the number 1 position?
4.Which song charted the longest in the Melon 200?
5.Which artists are the new leaders of kpop in South Korea?

**Data-Engineering-Pipeline-Using-Mage** - In this project I loaded Ny Taxi data for the months of OCTOBER,NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER 2020. I transfromed the data and then exported it to Postgres. All this was done using Mage
