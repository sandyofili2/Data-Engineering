# Data-Engineering

For every project listed only one programming langauge is used. I wanted to show my skills in each language by creating seperate projects with each language.In the last project I use multiple languages and dictionaries to create a seamless data pipeline.

**SQL_STORES** - In the SQL_STORES project I used the stores database that had customer, product, order etc information. 
The most important questions that I was looking to find answers to were: Top 5 biggest spenders, The top 5 leaset engaged customers, the average profit per customer which would then help us in determining how much to spend on advertising.

**Growth_of_Kpop** - In the Growth_of_Kpop Project I used pandas and numpy to do an analysis on top artists on the South Korean Melon Charts from 2010 to 2023. It consisted of analysing 66000 rows and 6 colums of data. I used Seaborn and Matplotlib for the visualization section of the project. I focused on answering questions to 5 questions:

1.Which artists had the most songs on the Melon 200 chart from 2010 till 2013?
2.Which artist has the most number 1 songs on Melon chart?
3.Which Korean song spent the longest time at the number 1 position?
4.Which song charted the longest in the Melon 200?
5.Which artists are the new leaders of kpop in South Korea?

**Data-Engineering-Pipeline-Using-Mage** - In this project I loaded Ny Taxi data for the months of OCTOBER,NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER 2020. I transfromed the data and then exported it to Postgres. All this was done using Mage

**DBT DATA TRANSFORMATION** - In this project I took taxi data information from NYC and then transformed them using DBT. DBT is good for transforming large datasets using SQL and managing those datasets. It also, makes it easy to transfer the datasets to LOOKER in which you can then create visualizations using the transformed data. DBT also allows for CI/CD.
